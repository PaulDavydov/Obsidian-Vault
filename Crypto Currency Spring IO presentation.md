- Apache Kafka is a big event storing platform
	- Stores events, not in things such as objects, but in events.
	- Not typically put into a database, instead put into a log format.
		- Writes down the state of the event, and stores in Topic, persistent record of events
			- Events stored in a way that can then put on a disk/storage
	- Microservices use kafka to communicate with each other
		- Events happen isntantly and allow for services, that are looking at the topics where the events are stored, to react instantly
- Low latenct on JVM
	- Remove the DB, fully in memory, eventual sync to disk
	- Inter machine communication. optimize process communication (IPC)
	- Netwrk communcation
		- UDP (User Datagram Protocol) - communcation protocol used across the Interent for especially time-sensititve transmissions such as video plahback or DNS lookup. It speeds up communcations by not formally estalishing a connection before data is transferred
	- No containers or Kubernetes
	- Distributed state machine
	- Single threaded state machines
	- app thread pinning to dedicated cores
- What are some design principles:
	- NO garbage collection on JVM
	- Smart batching in the message path
	- Lock free algos in the message path
	- non blocking Io in the message path
	- no exceptional cases in the path
	- Single wrtier principle
	- heavily prefer unshared state
	- avoid unnecessary data copies
	- no logging
	- no strings
- Everything is deterministic, meaning any message that you would put into the process, it will always come out the same, meaning you will always receive the same results
	- If there is an error, you set up a counter and then take the message that increased the counter and run it throught the process. The error should always appear there
- Never pass a string, too unopitmized, integers easier and faster to work with
- Aeron is a framework used by a lot of these tech companies: [Aeron Framework guide](https://aeron.io)
- Performance techniques for improving spring boot in. fintech
	- use batching, fine tune size
	- use agents
	- resuse object pools
	- apply backpressure
	- smart retries
	- use metrics/counters
	- minimize logging
	- fine tune your DB
		- For use case
		- query
	- No JPA - Java persistence API is a framework that provides a set of specifications and interfaces for managing relational data in java apps
		- Template is fine
	- Control offsets
- Fintech is a big fan of Azul Prime
	- Includes Azul Zing, and enhanced build of OpenJDK
		- Low consistent response latency
		- higher totla throughput and carrying capacity
		- faster warmip
	- Tech delivering these results:
		- C4 pauseless garbage collector
		- falcon JIT compiler
		- Ready now/Cloud Native Compiler
	- To enable, in docker file add the `FROM azul/prime:17` to the base image, and configure the JVM parameters `args: ["-c", "java - jar -Xmx10g application.jar]`
		- Only difference is to give it 10 gigs of heap
	- readynow allows you to do the warmup of our program, before you do the deployment of your application
		- 0 downtime in kubernetes
