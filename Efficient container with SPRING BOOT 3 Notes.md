Why do we care about runtime efficiency?
- cheaper hosting, sustainability (less resources needed to run it), and optimized containers/code
- Different types of optimization:
	- Faster startup times
	- Warm up is done quicker, with peak performance available asap
	- Scalability, same throughput with less resources
	- Memory, reduced memory consumption
- Class Data Sharing - essentially you will run a test run of your application, create a app.jsa cache, which will then be used in the future to promote faster startup and lower memory consumption.
	- YOU WILL STOP THE TEST RUN BEFORE SPRING GETS INITIATED
- WHAT IS RECOMMENDED TO USE:
	- JVM with CDS recommended for better efficiency with few constraints
	- Native with GraalVM is a great option if you can deal with long build times and compatibility challenges
	- CraAC only used on Linux
- Spring boot 3.3 allows for JAR files to self extract
