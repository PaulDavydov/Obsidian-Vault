- what is an agent?
	- AI Model capable of reasoning, planning, and interacting with its environment
	- We call it agent because it has agenecy, ability to interacty with the environment
	- A more formal definition: a system that leverages an AI model to interact with its environment in order to achieve a user-defined objective. It combines reasoning, planning, and the execution of actions (often via external tools) to fulfill tasks
- Agents have two main parts
	- The Brain(AI Model):
		- Where all the thinking happens. AI Model handles reasoning and planning. It decides which Actions to take based on the situation
	- The Body(Capabilities and Tools):
		- Part represents everything the Agent is equipped to do
- Scope of possible actions a agent can take, is dependent on what the agent has been equipped with
- Most common AI model found in agents is an LLM (Large Language Model)
	- Takes text as input and outputs text as well
	- EX: GPT4, OpenAI, LLama, Gemini, etc
		- These models are trained on a vast amount of text and are able to generalize well
- Another example is the VLM (Visual Lanuage Model)
	- Similar to LLM but also understands images as input
- How do LLM, that output only text, generate images?
	- ChatGPT and HuggingChat implement additional functionality (called Tools), that the LLM can use to create images
- An agent can perform any task we implement via tools to complete Actions
	- If we wanted it to write and send an email, we can give it some code to sned emails
	- the design of the tools is important and has a great impact on the quality of your agent
- Summary:
	- Ai Agents use the core reasoning engine to:
		- Understand natural language: interpret and respond to human instructions in a meaningful way
		- Reason and plan: analyze info, make decisions, and devise strategies to solve problems
		- Interact with its environment: gather info, take actions, and observe the results of those actions
