## 2.1 The Smolagents Framework
### Introduction to smolagents
- It is a hugging face library
- simple yet powerful framework for building AI agents
	- Provides LLMs with the agenecy to interact with the real world
		- eg: searching or generating images
- Reasons to use smolagents
	- Simplicity
		- minimal code complexity and abstractions
	- Flexible LLm Support
		- works with any LLM through integration with hugging face tools and external APIs
	- Code-First Approach
		- first-class support for Code Agents that write their actions directly in code, removing the need for parsing and simplifying tool calling
	- HF Hub Integration
		- integration with the Hugging Face Hub, allowing usage of Gradio Spaces as tools
- When to use:
	- Lightweight and minimal solution
	- experiment quickly
	- application logic is straightforward
- Agents in smolagents operate as multi-step agents
	- each agent does one thought and one tool call/execution
### Building agents that use code
- Code agents are the default agent type in smol agents
- Code agents are shown to work more effecitvely with code directly
	- Easily combine and resuse actions
	- Work directly with complex structures like images
	- Express any computationally possible task
	- High-quality code is already present in LLM training data
- How code agents work
	- System prompt is stored in a SystemPromptStep, user query is logged in a TaskStep
	- Then the while loop is executed
		- Method agent.write_memory_to_messages() writes the agent's logs into a list of LLM-readable chat messages
		- messages are sent to a Model (LLM), which generates a completion
		- completion is parsed to extract the action, which, in our case, should be a code snippet since we are working with a CodeAgent
		- action is exectued
		- results are logged in an ActionStep
- At the end of each step, if the agent includes any function calls, they are executed
