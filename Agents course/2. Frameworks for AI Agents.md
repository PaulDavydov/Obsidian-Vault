## 2.1 The Smolagents Framework
### Introduction to smolagents
- It is a hugging face library
- simple yet powerful framework for building AI agents
	- Provides LLMs with the agenecy to interact with the real world
		- eg: searching or generating images
- Reasons to use smolagents
	- Simplicity
		- minimal code complexity and abstractions
	- Flexible LLm Support
		- works with any LLM through integration with hugging face tools and external APIs
	- Code-First Approach
		- first-class support for Code Agents that write their actions directly in code, removing the need for parsing and simplifying tool calling
	- HF Hub Integration
		- integration with the Hugging Face Hub, allowing usage of Gradio Spaces as tools
- When to use:
	- Lightweight and minimal solution
	- experiment quickly
	- application logic is straightforward
- Agents in smolagents operate as multi-step agents
	- each agent does one thought and one tool call/execution
