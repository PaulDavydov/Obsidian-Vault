- Events are a first-class product in our microservice
- Meet consumer needs, reliable, accessible and easy to use
- Events must contain the right data
- Might want to favor more rich and detailed events over simpler ones
	- More detail allows for more services to leverage the data
	- Can come back in the future to optimize for unused data
- Data needs to be presented in a consumable format
	- Protobuf and Avro (binary numbers) great for efficiency and bandwidth
		- NOT HUMAN READABLE
		- Needs tools to convert them
	- JSON is human readable, but bulkier
		- Makes records more easy to debug
- Treat the data format as a contract
- Outages can cause severe trust issues between our serivces and consumers
- EDA alleviates some of these concerns by delivering messages regardless of the outage
	- Messages are delivered asychnronously
- Long outages are still an issue, so multiple back up services need to exist
	- These take over if others fail
	- Use K8 to keep the services running without severe disruption
- A typical system will have the consumers listen for events, enrich the data, and create a new event for the data
	- The events feed back to the system allowing for more enrichment opportunities
- WIth enough messages we reach CRITICAL MASS
- EDA is extremely decoupled
- All services run without interference and do not rely on each other to run
	- This is thanks to the queue
- A Kafka topic is a logical channel that organizes and stores messages in Apache Kafka
	- simply, they are the categories used to organize messages
