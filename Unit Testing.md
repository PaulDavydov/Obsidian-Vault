- Making sure a single piece of code actually works correctly
- call it using from a dependecny tool that you might be using, Maven Gradle
- A unit test is just a method with the @Test annotation
- Make sure the unit test just tests for a single scenario

	- assert that the method call equals what we expect
- every unit test we right will have a few assert statements within it
