## Core Java Concepts

1. What is the difference between JDK and JRE?
	- The JDK is the development kit of the Java language. It contains the JRE as well. Biggest difference is the JDK is meant to develop code vs JRE is meant to run it
2. Why is Java a platform independent language?
	- It is a platform independent language, on the condition that if the platform can run the JRE, otherwise it will not be able to.
3. What is the difference between an abstract class and an interface?
	- Interface can view it as a contract or a promise that a class will do/have. Essentially ensures that the implementing class will take the methods the interface provides, and adds some logic to them. 
	- Abstract class is a basis for different subclasses that share behavior which does not need to be repeatedly created. Subclasses must complete the behavior and have the option to override the predefined behavior.
4. What is the difference between final, finally, and finalize?
	- Final is used in Java to declare entities in our code, that cannot be later modified. It applies to variables, methods, and classes
		- When intializing a final variable, it must only be intitiazlied once. Any changes to it will cause a compile-time error
		- When initializinng a final method, these methods cannot be overridden in any subclass. Useful when you need to implement a consistent method across a variety of subclasses
		- Final class means that the class cannot be subclassed. Helps create a fully immutable object, that will define certain behaviors that cannot be changed
	- Finally is used during instances of Java exception handling. Usually added to the end of a try-catch block, making sure to run code regardless if a exception was thrown or caught.
	- Finalize method is called by the garbage collector, when it determines that there are no more references to the object. Can be overriden by objects
5. What is the difference between stack and heap memory?
	- The difference being when the allocation of memory happens. For stack memory it happens during the function call stack. the size of the memory is known to the compiler
	- heap memory is allocated during the execution of instructions written by developers. Everytime we create an object, it is stored in the heap space, while stack contains the referencing information of the object
6. What is the difference between method overloading and method overriding?
	- Overloading happens when two or more methods are created in a object. The difference being, is that one may ask for more parameters than the other. compile time
	- Overriding occurs when inheriting a class from a interface or another object. Essentially we take the method and implement our own logic into it. Though the name, return type, and paramters must be the same. run time
7. What is the difference between a private and a protected modifier?
	- Private entails only the class it is implemented on, can modify/access it
	- protected means the same package or subclass in the a different package can access this method
	- public means that anyone can access it
	- default means that only classes in the same package can access it
8. What is constructor overloading in Java?
	- Happens when two or more constructors are created in a class. Essentailly provides us with two more methods of creating that class via its constructor
9. What is the use of super keyword in Java?
	- Super refers to the superclass (parent) objects. it is used to call superclass methods and access the superclass constructor
10. What is the difference between static methods, static variables, and static classes in Java?
	- Static keyword is mainly used for memory management. it essentially applies to the class it is implemented in, and acts like a constant
		- Variables: states that a single copy of that variable is created and shared among all objects at the class level. Can be viewed as global variables
		- Methods: essentially it is a method that is essentially considered constant as well. It is used to only interact with static variables and methods
		- Classes: can only be a static class if it is a nested class. Static classes cannot access non-static memebers of the outer class
11. What exactly is System.out.println in Java?
	- it essentially is used to print an argument that is passed into it.
		- System: final class defined in the java.lang package
		- Out: instance of the PrintStream type, which is a public and static member field of the System class
		- println(): all instances of the PrintStream class have a public method println() that we can invoke. It essentially prints out our argument, following that it will add a new line.
12. What part of memory - Stack or Heap - is cleaned in the garbage collection process?
	- Garbage collection collects the heap memory. usually the stack memory is collected automatically when the execution path reaches the end of the scope
