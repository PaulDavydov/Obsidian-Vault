### State of a qubit
- the fundamental unit of info is known as the bit
- quantum computers are made up of quantum bits, or qubits
	- Just like a bit, the qubit has a state, but instead of a 0 or 1 as a standard bit, it instead is a vector
	- the vector space is known as the state space, 2d vector
- How the a qubit and a bit is similar, both have a state and is an abstract mathematical object
- two special quantum states which correspond to the 0 and 1 states of a classical bit.
	- Quantum state corresponding to 0 is usually denoted |0>
		- this state is called computational basis state
		- this is considered a single mathematical object
	- the | > are called ket notation and the |0> is considered a kets. but in general we mean that it is a vector
	- |0> is a computational basis state for a qubit and it plays the same role as a 0 does for a classical bit
### General states of qubit
- the |0> |1> are just two possible states for a qubit
	- many more states are possible as well
	- these extra states endow qubits with capabilities not available to ordinary classical bits
- in general there are complex vectors, that is they can have complex numbers as entries
- Superposition, means that the state is a linear combination of |0> or |1>
- Amplitude, the coefficient for a particular state in superposition
- 0.6|0> the amplitude of 0 is 0.6
- Constratin for quantum states and their 2d vectors
	- the sumes of the squares of the ampiitudes must be equal to 1
- the quantum state of a qubit is a vector of unit length in a 2d complex vector space known as state space

## Introducing logic gates
- Quantum logic gate is simply a way of manipulating quantum info.
	- the quantum state of qubit or a collection of qubits
	- analogous to the classical gates used in everday computers: AND, OR, NOT
	- basic building blocks of quantum computation
