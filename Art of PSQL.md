- for the genre-topn query, we do a left join lateral
	- implements a nested loop over the genres and allows to fetch our top n. tracks per genre
- the correlated subq runs for each genre and is parameterized with the current genreid thanks to the clause where track.genreid = genre.genreid.
	- this is how the where clause implements the correlation between the outer loop and the inner loops
- once the inner loop is done, the lateral subq named ss we join again with the album and artist tables
